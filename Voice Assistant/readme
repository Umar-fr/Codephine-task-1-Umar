I have created a basic voice assistant with the help of libraries like speechrecognition, datetime, webbrowser, pyautogui, numpy, cv2, pywhatkit, pyttsx3 and wikipedia.
pyttsx3 is the vocie engine which does covers the text to speech region. Speech recognition is used for NLP and others are used for the command part.
