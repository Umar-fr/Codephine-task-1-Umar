### Hello Everyone!
This repository consists of the tasks that are provided to me by the Codephine Internship.
# 1. VOICE ASSISTANT
I will be creating a basic voice assistant that can perform simple tasks based on voice commands. I will be implement features like responding to "Hello" and providing predefined responses, telling the time or date, and searching the web for information based on user queries.
-> Some of the Key Concepts and Challenges of the project are as follows:
. Speech Recognition: Learn how to recognize and process voice commands using speech recognition libraries or APIs.

# 2. RANDOM PASSWORD GENERATOR
I will be Creating a command-line password generator in Python that generates random passwords based on user-defined criteria, such as length and character types (letters, numbers, symbols). Allowing users to specify password length and character set preferences.
-> Key Concepts and Challenges:
. Randomization: Learn how to generate random characters and strings.
. User Input Validation: Validate user input for password length and character types.
. Character Set Handling: Manage different character sets (letters, numbers, symbols).

# 3. CHAT APPLICATION
I will be Creating a basic text-based chat application in Python where two users can exchange messages in real-time using the command line. I will implement a simple client-server model for message exchange.
-> Key Concepts and Challenges:
. Networking (for Beginners): Learn socket programming for real-time communication between clients and a server.
